# Simple Python Port Scanner 🔍

This project is a basic **TCP port scanner** written in Python.  
It scans a target IP address over a given range of ports and reports:
- Open ports
- Known basic vulnerabilities associated with common ports

The scanner also saves the results in a text file (`open_ports.txt`) for future reference.


## 📦 Features

- User input for target IP and port range
- Fast scanning with socket timeouts
- Basic vulnerability hints based on open ports
- Results saved automatically in a `.txt` file
- Clear and easy-to-read output
